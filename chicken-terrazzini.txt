INGREDIENTS

1 lb. linguine
3 tbsp. butter, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 c. Mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
1 1/2 c. chicken stock
1 c. heavy cream
kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2/3 c. freshly grated Parmesan
1 tbsp. Chopped parsley, for garnish

DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Prepare linguine according to the instructions on the box.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter.
Cook garlic until fragrant, 1 minute, then add in mushrooms and
cook until most of their moisture is released and they are golden on
both sides. Add chicken and cook until partially cooked, 5 minutes.
Transfer mushrooms and chicken to a plate and set aside.
Return skillet to medium heat and melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
Whisk in flour until completely combined, then slowly whisk in chicken
stock and bring to a simmer. Pour in cream and again bring to simmer over
low heat, stirring occasionally and allowing the sauce to thicken, about 10
minutes.
Place pasta into a baking dish along with chicken and mushrooms.
Pour sauce over mixture and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
Sprinkle with Parmesan and bake for 25 minutes, until sauce is bubbling
and Parmesan crust is golden.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
